# Basic University Network
## Related to the 'Computer Networks' course that I take.
<br>
This is a project that I've created a basic university network. It includes 5 faculties. In each department, there are four offices, two classrooms and two laboratories. In many labs, I used IoT items. Project includes Server Room, connections between items and other cable connections.
